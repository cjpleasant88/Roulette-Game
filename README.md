## Future Updates
-The game is rather large for what it accomplishes.
Much of the code is reiterated in each of the 10 methods for the different bet types.
Optimizing the code, such as pulling out common validation code blocks into their own method should be done.

-Adding an Array in the Player class to store up to 5 bets would allow the player to bet multiple times within a single game. This would simulate more of how playing the game in real life would be

-At the end, adding the winning numbers for the 10 different bet types would be nice to see
